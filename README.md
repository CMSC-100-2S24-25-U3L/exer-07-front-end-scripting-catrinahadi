Title: Practice front-end scripting 

Author: HADI, Maria Catrina O. 

Section: CMSC 100 - U3L 

Exercise 07

Description: This program shows what we learned in Week 7, like how to use the DOM and Event Listeners. It asks the user to enter details about a food item and checks if the form is filled out correctly. After submitting, the webpage updates to show the userâ€™s input. The program keeps track of the entries, shows them by rank, and has a delete button that removes an item and updates the page.
